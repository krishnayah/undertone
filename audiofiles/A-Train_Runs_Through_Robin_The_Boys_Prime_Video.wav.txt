 The seventh Queen Maiden home lander made another heroic save today, stopping a hijacked armored truck on the streets of Brooklyn,
 and staying behind for a photo office with some very lucky fans.
 Jean, thanks, Jennifer, and now we love you.
 So this is pretty much everything in one Bluetooth speakers.
 It's in stereo, so you can put it all around your living room, have some fun with it.
 You said you have a standard cable box, right?
 Uh-huh.
 Okay, then I need to get you an audio transmitter, APTX, low latency, it makes it so there's less audio lag,
 and it's got a standard optical lens.
 And let's hook you up with 1000 meg HDMI, let's go with this one.
 Uh, it costs a little bit more, but the carbon's way more conductive.
 Hey, Gary.
 Um, I really need to talk to you about something real.
 It's a later kid.
 Okay, cool.
 Later, like, in like 30 minutes, like a solid 45.
 Excuse me, sir.
 Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for you to come over and lay some cable.
 Okay, uh, oh, Robin.
 Oh, dear, dear Robin.
 Um, that doesn't mean what you think it means.
 Um, laying cable means sex.
 No, laying pipe means sex.
 Laying cable means you want me to come over to your house and just take a big ol' shit.
 That's disgusting.
 Well, okay, but who said it, though?
 Okay, are you ready?
 Despite your best efforts, I'm actually still hungry.
 I'm actually more hungry now.
 Where are we gonna go after all this hot talk?
 More importantly, where are we gonna go to lay some cable afterwards?
 Jeez.
 So did you ask him?
 Who?
 Gary.
 Did you ask Gary for the raise?
 Yeah, yeah, it was a, look, it was a crazy day and he was super busy, but tomorrow, for sure.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 What was I supposed to do?
 Was I kick his door down?
 Like, homelander?
 I said okay.
 Yeah, but he didn't mean it.
 Hey, I see the look.
 I see it.
 Come on.
 This is like when we started dating.
 I don't think that's, I don't think that's true.
 Dude, I had to ask you out.
 Well, excuse me for waiting.
 You ever hear of chivalry?
 Listen, this is about you getting what you deserve.
 I'm killing myself at school because I think it's gonna be worth it for both of us.
 You know, if we move in together.
 Wait, what?
 What?
 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
 What was that?
 What'd you just say?
 Well, I mean, we can't keep, you know, laying pipe at your dad's place.
 Trying to be all quiet.
 Staring up with that dumb Billy Joel boaster.
 Boaster?
 Yeah.
 When you ever dismerge Billy-
